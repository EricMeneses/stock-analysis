## Overview
Steve asked us to assist him in his stock analysis. After preparing a workbook for him, he would like to expand the data set to include the entire stock market over the last few years.

## Results

We can see that our new code is able to run through all of the data in about 0.1 second. Much quicker than our original script we created in our module.
